                                    <p>The single most important highlight of the work of QGA has been in providing professional services for religious clients. The creation of sacred space can be accomplished with the common, the extra-ordinary, the unique, the complex, the simple or the obvious.  Each individual may have uniquely different reactions to space creation due to the placement of planes, textures, colors, light and shapes or to the manipulation of light and sound. Our ability to listen, understand and communicate to church leaders and building committees and our passion for our work, is the foundation for this successful legacy.</p>

                                    <p>Many architectural firms seek a special niche for their firm development and find themselves repeating the same solutions to the same design issues.  For this reason, we have maintained an interest in various project types, including civic, educational, and institutional clients that tend to become overly invested in standard practice.  Our school solutions include the first LEED Gold certified elementary school in the Escambia County, which was one of the first schools to adopt Twenty First Century Learning Concepts.</p>

                                    <p>QG Architects was established in 1984 in Pensacola, Florida.  At the time, there were several well established architectural firms, but few with the insight to break the trend and approach local projects with a sense of history as an important element in the design of new buildings.  Drawing on Pensacola’s 450 years of history, the result was a new appreciation of historic buildings for adaptive reuse, preservation projects, and as an influence on the design of new buildings.  The firm has been the Architect for the restoration and adaptive reuse of many Pensacola Landmarks.</p>
